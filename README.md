# TheHive Testing Lab

TheHive4 is running at localhost:9000. It has default credentials ` admin@thehive.local:secret `.
The default user can only be used for managing the organisations etc. so you need to create organisation and a "normal" user for it to access TheHive.

TheHive3 is running at localhost:8999. You can choose your credentials at the first startup.
